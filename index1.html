        <h3>Turning your data into insights</h3>
        <p>My name is Michael Ouma, a data scientist with a background in software engineering and a degree in Biostatistics.</p>
        <p>I work remotely as a freelance data scientist. Getting insights out of data is something that I really like. Data visualization and machine learning are some techniques that I am using to achieve this.</p>
        <p>I am a big open source believer since I think with sharing solutions we can achieve a lot more as a community. Therefore I prefer to use R and Python for my daily work.</p>
        <p>On my portfolio you can find some examples of my projects, most of them are interactive visualization.</p>
        <p>Have fun in browsing through the content and thank you for visiting!</p>

        <h3>Data Visualization</h3>
        <p>A picture says more than a thousand words... but what exactly do you want to visualize?</p>
        <p>I have seen a lot of examples of very good but also very bad visualizations. For example, a pie chart with more than 3 or 4 categories is not readable in my opinion. Because people are better at comparing lengths than areas, a bar chart is a better choice in many cases. I use rainbow colors only occasionally since there is no “greater than” ordering in colors, making it hard for a human to compare quantitative data. Until now, I have used R/Shiny, Plotly, and Python for my data visualizations, with most experience in the R, SPSS and Python.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="service-item">
        <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>Need to make predictions based on historical data? Or want to explore your data for certain patterns?</p>
        <p>Machine learning is a discipline that can be applied to a lot of domains. IBM Watson is changing the world of healthcare by applying machine learning, and many companies are working on self-driving cars which rely on these techniques.</p>
        <p>I have experience with supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. In recent projects, I have predicted nitrate levels from image analysis and built a fraud detection algorithm based on historical transactions.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="service-item">
        <h3>Remote Training</h3>
        <p>Are you interested in visualizing your data yourself? Do you want to start with R programming?</p>
        <p>I offer remote training for a variety of topics related to R. In only a half day, you can be up and running with R and start analyzing your data.</p>
        <p>Topics for beginners include: Introduction to R/RStudio, Git, RMarkdown, and Shiny. Please contact me for specific training needs.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="service-item">
        <h3>Data Collection</h3>
        <p>Need to collect data from the field effectively? I can help set up robust data collection systems using Kobotoolbox and SurveyToGo.</p>
        <p>These tools are ideal for remote and offline data collection. With Kobotoolbox's user-friendly interface and SurveyToGo's powerful survey capabilities, I ensure that your data is captured accurately and efficiently, whether you're working in urban environments or remote field locations.</p>
